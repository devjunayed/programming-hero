/* 
    Problem:
    ========
    You have an odd array (array with odd numbers). [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].
    Now convert this array into an even array (array with even numbers). [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. Do this using for loop & array.map() method.
    Hints: add one to any odd numbers and it will become an even number.
